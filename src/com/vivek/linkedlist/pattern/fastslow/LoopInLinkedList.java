/**
 * There are three ways to solve this problem
 * 1. Use Hashing
 * 
 * Traverse the list one by one and keep putting the node addresses 
 * in a Hash Table. At any point, if NULL is reached then return false and if next
 * of current node points to any of the previously stored nodes in Hash then return true.
 * 
 * 2. Mark Visited Nodes
 * 
 * This solution requires modifications to basic linked list data structure. 
 * Have a visited flag with each node. Traverse the linked list and keep marking visited nodes.
 * If you see a visited node again then there is a loop.
 * This solution works in O(n) but requires additional information with each node.
 * 
 * 3. Floyd's Cycle finding algortihm
 * 
 * This is the fastest method. Traverse linked list using two pointers. 
 * Move one pointer by one and other pointer by two. 
 * If these pointers meet at some node then there is a loop. 
 * If pointers do not meet then linked list doesnï¿½t have loop.
 *
 * Reference:
 * Grokking the Coding Interview
 * Pattern: Fast Slow
