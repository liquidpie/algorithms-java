/**
 * Given only a pointer to a node to be deleted in a singly linked list, how do you delete it?
 *
 * A simple solution is to traverse the linked list until you find the node you want to delete.
 * But this solution requires a pointer to the head node which contradicts the problem statement.
 *
 * The fast solution is to copy the data from the next node to the node to be deleted and delete the next node.
 *
 * Note: It is important to note that this approach will only work if it is guaranteed that the given pointer does not point to the last node.
 * Because if it is the last node, then you donâ€™t have a next node to copy the data from.
