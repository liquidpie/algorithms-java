/**
 * Todo
 *
 * Also known as Longest Repeated Substring
 *
 * Given a string s, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of s that occur 2 or more times. The occurrences may overlap.
 *
 * Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length. If s does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is "".
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "banana"
 * Output: "ana"
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "abcd"
 * Output: ""
