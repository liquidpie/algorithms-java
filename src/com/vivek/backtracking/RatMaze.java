/**
 * A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down.
 *
 * In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination. Note that this is a simple version of the typical Maze problem. For example, a more complex version can be that the rat can move in 4 directions and a more complex version can be with a limited number of moves.
 *
 * Following is a binary matrix representation of the maze.
 *
 * {1, 0, 0, 0}
 * {1, 1, 0, 1}
 * {0, 1, 0, 0}
 * {1, 1, 1, 1}
 *
 * Following is the solution matrix (output of program) for the above input matrix.
 *
 * {1, 0, 0, 0}
 * {1, 1, 0, 0}
 * {0, 1, 0, 0}
 * {0, 1, 1, 1}
 * All entries in solution path are marked as 1.
 *
 * Approach: Form a recursive function, which will follow a path and check if the path reaches the destination or not. If the path does not reach the destination then backtrack and try other paths.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *
 *     1. Create a solution matrix, initially filled with 0â€™s.
 *     2. Create a recursive function, which takes initial matrix, output matrix and position of rat (i, j).
 *     3. if the position is out of the matrix or the position is not valid then return.
 *     4. Mark the position output[i][j] as 1 and check if the current position is destination or not. If destination is reached print the output matrix and return.
 *     5. Recursively call for position (i+1, j) and (i, j+1).
 *     6. Unmark position (i, j), i.e output[i][j] = 0.
