/**
 * The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
 *
 * The expected output is a binary matrix which has 1s for the blocks where queens are placed.
 * For example, following is the output matrix for 4 queen solution.
 *
 *               { 0,  1,  0,  0}
 *               { 0,  0,  0,  1}
 *               { 1,  0,  0,  0}
 *               { 0,  0,  1,  0}
 *
 * Backtracking Algorithm:
 * The idea is to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from the leftmost column.
 * When we place a queen in a column, we check for clashes with already placed queens.
 * In the current column, if we find a row for which there is no clash, we mark this row and column as part of the solution.
 * If we do not find such a row due to clashes then we backtrack and return false.
 *
 * 1) Start in the leftmost column
 * 2) If all queens are placed
 *     return true
 * 3) Try all rows in the current column.
 *    Do following for every tried row.
 *     a) If the queen can be placed safely in this row
 *        then mark this [row, column] as part of the
 *        solution and recursively check if placing
 *        queen here leads to a solution.
 *     b) If placing the queen in [row, column] leads to
 *        a solution then return true.
 *     c) If placing queen doesn't lead to a solution then
 *        unmark this [row, column] (Backtrack) and go to
 *        step (a) to try other rows.
 * 3) If all rows have been tried and nothing worked,
 *    return false to trigger backtracking.
