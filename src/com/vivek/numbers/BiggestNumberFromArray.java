/**
 * Given an array of numbers, arrange them in a way that yields the largest value.
 * For example, if the given numbers are {54, 546, 548, 60}, the arrangement 6054854654 gives the largest value.
 * And if the given numbers are {1, 34, 3, 98, 9, 76, 45, 4}, then the arrangement 998764543431 gives the largest value.
 *
 * A simple solution that comes to our mind is to sort all numbers in descending order, but simply sorting doesnâ€™t work.
 * For example, 548 is greater than 60, but in output 60 comes before 548. As a second example, 98 is greater than 9, but 9 comes before 98 in output.
 *
 * Given two numbers X and Y, we compare two numbers XY (Y appended at the end of X) and YX (X appended at the end of Y).
 * If XY is larger, then X should come before Y in output, else Y should come before. For example, let X and Y be 542 and 60.
 * To compare X and Y, we compare 54260 and 60542. Since 60542 is greater than 54260, we put Y first.
