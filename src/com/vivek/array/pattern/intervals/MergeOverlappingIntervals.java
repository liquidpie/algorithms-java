/**
 * Given a set of time intervals in any order, merge all overlapping intervals into one and output the result
 * which should have only mutually exclusive intervals.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     Input: Intervals = {{1,3},{2,4},{6,8},{9,10}}
 *     Output: {{1, 4}, {6, 8}, {9, 10}}
 *     Explanation: Given intervals: [1,3],[2,4],[6,8],[9,10], we have only two overlapping intervals here,[1,3] and [2,4]. Therefore we will merge these two and return [1,4],[6,8], [9,10].
 *
 *     Input: Intervals = {{6,8},{1,9},{2,4},{4,7}}
 *     Output: {{1, 9}}
 *
 *
 * Approach:
 *
 * The idea to solve this problem is, first sort the intervals according to the starting time.
 * Once we have the sorted intervals, we can combine all intervals in a linear traversal.
 * The idea is, in sorted array of intervals, if interval[i] doesnâ€™t overlap with interval[i-1],
 * then interval[i+1] cannot overlap with interval[i-1] because starting time of interval[i+1]
 * must be greater than or equal to interval[i].
 *
 * Follow the steps mentioned below to implement the approach:
 *
 *     Sort the intervals based on the increasing order of starting time.
 *     Push the first interval into a stack.
 *     For each interval do the following:
 *         If the current interval does not overlap with the top of the stack then, push the current interval into the stack.
 *         If the current interval overlap with the top of the stack then, update the stack top with the ending time of the current interval.
 *     The end stack contains the merged intervals.
