/**
 * A bipartite graph also called a bi-graph, is a set of graph vertices, i.e, points where multiple lines meet,
 * decomposed into two disjoint sets, meaning they have no element in common, such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent.
 *
 *      Adjacent nodes are any two nodes that are connected by an edge.
 *
 * A bipartite graph is a special case of a k-partite graph with k = 2.
 *
 * Bipartite graphs are equivalent to two-colorable graphs i.e., coloring of the vertices using two colors in such a way that vertices of the same color are never adjacent along an edge.
 * All Acyclic graphs are bipartite. A cyclic graph is bipartite if all its cycles are of even length.
 *
 * A Bipartite Graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two independent sets, U and V such that every edge (u, v)
 * either connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex from V to U. In other words, for every edge (u, v), either u belongs to U and v to V,
 * or u belongs to V and v to U. We can also say that there is no edge that connects vertices of same set.
 *
 * Approach:
 *
 * Following is a simple algorithm to find out whether a given graph is Birpartite or not using Breadth First Search (BFS).
 * 1. Assign RED color to the source vertex (putting into set U).
 * 2. Color all the neighbors with BLUE color (putting into set V).
 * 3. Color all neighborâ€™s neighbor with RED color (putting into set U).
 * 4. This way, assign color to all vertices such that it satisfies all the constraints of m way coloring problem where m = 2.
 * 5. While assigning colors, if we find a neighbor which is colored with same color as current vertex, then the graph cannot be colored with 2 vertices (or graph is not Bipartite)
