/**
 * Queue Reconstruction by Height
 *
 * You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each people[i] = [hi, ki] represents the ith person of height hi with exactly ki other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to hi.
 *
 * Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [hj, kj] is the attributes of the jth person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
 * Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
 * Explanation:
 * Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
 * Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
 * Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
 * Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
 * Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
 * Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
 * Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
 * Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]
 *
 *          * Approach: We sort the array of people using the height from tallest
 *          * to shortest. After that we place the elements of the array in a list using the
 *          * number of people who should be infront of this person who have a height
 *          * greater than or equal to that particular element.
 *          *
 *          * Time Complexity: O(nlgn)
 *          * Space Complexity: O(n)
