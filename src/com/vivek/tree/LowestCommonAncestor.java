 * traverse the com.vivek.tree starting from root. If any of the given keys (n1 and n2) matches with root,

 * If root doesnï¿½t match with any of the keys, we recur for left and right subtree. 
 * The node which has one key present in its left subtree and 
 * the other key present in right subtree is the LCA. If both keys lie in left subtree, 
 * then left subtree has LCA also, otherwise LCA lies in right subtree.
