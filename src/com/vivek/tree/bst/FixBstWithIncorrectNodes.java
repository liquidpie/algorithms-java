/**
 * Two nodes of a BST are swapped, correct the BST
 *
 * Input Tree:
 *          10
 *         /  \
 *        5    8
 *       / \
 *      2   20
 *
 * In the above tree, nodes 20 and 8 must be swapped to fix the tree.
 * Following is the output tree
 *          10
 *         /  \
 *        5    20
 *       / \
 *      2   8
 *
 * The inorder traversal of a BST produces a sorted array. So a simple method is to store inorder traversal of the input tree in an auxiliary array.
 * Sort the auxiliary array. Finally, insert the auxiliary array elements back to the BST, keeping the structure of the BST same.
 * The time complexity of this method is O(nLogn) and the auxiliary space needed is O(n).
 *
 * We can solve this in O(n) time and with a single traversal of the given BST. Since inorder traversal of BST is always a sorted array, the problem can be reduced to a problem where two elements of a sorted array are swapped. There are two cases that we need to handle:
 * 1. The swapped nodes are not adjacent in the inorder traversal of the BST.
 *
 *  For example, Nodes 5 and 25 are swapped in {3 5 7 8 10 15 20 25}.
 *  The inorder traversal of the given tree is 3 25 7 8 10 15 20 5
 *
 * If we observe carefully, during inorder traversal, we find node 7 is smaller than the previous visited node 25. Here save the context of node 25 (previous node). Again, we find that node 5 is smaller than the previous node 20. This time, we save the context of node 5 (the current node ). Finally, swap the two nodeâ€™s values.
 * 2. The swapped nodes are adjacent in the inorder traversal of BST.
 *
 *   For example, Nodes 7 and 8 are swapped in {3 5 7 8 10 15 20 25}.
 *   The inorder traversal of the given tree is 3 5 8 7 10 15 20 25
 *
 * Unlike case #1, here only one point exists where a node value is smaller than the previous node value. e.g. node 7 is smaller than node 8.
 *
 * How to Solve?
 * We will maintain three-pointers, first, middle, and last. When we find the first point where the current node value is smaller than the previous node value,
 * we update the first with the previous node & the middle with the current node.
 * When we find the second point where the current node value is smaller than the previous node value,
 * we update the last with the current node. In the case of #2, we will never find the second point.
 * So, the last pointer will not be updated. After processing, if the last node value is null, then two swapped nodes of BST are adjacent.
