/**
 * In a BST context, **In-Order Traversal** means visiting nodes in a specific order: left child, parent, and then right child.
 * This order gives us sorted data for a BST. Letâ€™s explore this with a brief step-by-step approach:
 *
 *     Start at the root.
 *     Go as far left as possible.
 *     Visit the node (print/store the value).
 *     Move to the right subtree.
 *     Repeat until all nodes are visited.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(h)
 *
 * Where n is the number of nodes in the tree, and h is the height of the tree.
