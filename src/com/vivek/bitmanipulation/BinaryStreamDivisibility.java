/**
 * Check divisibility in a binary stream
 *
 * Stream of binary number is coming, the task is to tell the number formed so far is divisible by a given number n.
 * At any given time, you will get 0 or 1 and tell whether the number formed with these bits is divisible by n or not.
 *
 * Solution:
 *
 * In this solution, we just maintain the remainder if remainder is 0, the formed number is divisible by n otherwise not.
 * This is the same technique that is used in Automata to remember the state.
 * Here also we are remembering the state of divisibility of input number. In order to implement this technique,
 * we need to observe how the value of a binary number changes, when it is appended by 0 or 1. Letâ€™s take an example.
 * Suppose you have binary number 1. If it is appended by 0 it will become 10 (2 in decimal) means 2 times of the previous value.
 *
 * If it is appended by 1 it will become 11(3 in decimal), 2 times of previous value +1.
 * How does it help in getting the remainder?
 * Any number (n) can be written in the form m = an + r where a, n and r are integers and r is the remainder.
 * So when m is multiplied by any number so the remainder.
 * Suppose m is multiplied by x so m will be mx = xan + xr. so (mx)%n = (xan)%n + (xr)%n = 0 + (xr)%n = (xr)%n;
 * We need to just do the above calculation (calculation of value of number when it is appended by 0 or 1 ) only over remainder.
 *
 * When a binary number is appended by 0 (means
 * multiplied by 2), the new remainder can be
 * calculated based on current remainder only.
 * r = 2*r % n;
 *
 * And when a binary number is appended by 1.
 * r = (2*r + 1) % n;
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of inputs
 * Auxiliary Space: O(1)
